##                                      Project Objectives✨
         - Know fundamental concepts and techniques of the Artificial Neural Network and Convolution Neural Networks.
         
         - Gain a broad understanding of image data.
         
         - Work with Sequential type of modeling
         
         - Work with Keras capabilities
         
         - Work with image processing techniques
         
         - know how to build a web application using the Flask framework.
##                                    Project Flow:
         -  User interacts with User interface to upload image
         
         -  Uploaded image is analyzed by the model which is integrated
         
         -  Once model analyses the uploaded image, the prediction is showcased on the UI
###          To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below
###                Data Collection:
       Collect the dataset or Create the dataset
###     Data Preprocessing:
1.Import the ImageDataGenerator library

2.Configure ImageDataGenerator class

3.Apply ImageDataGenerator functionality to Trainset and Testset

###    Model Building:

1.Import the model building Libraries

2.Initializing the model

3.Adding Input Layer

4.Adding Hidden Layer

5.Adding Output Layer

6.Configure the Learning Process

7.Training and testing the model

8.Optimize the Model

9.Save the Model

###  Application Building:
1.Create an HTML file

2.Build Python Code

##   Project Structure

Create a Project folder which contains files as shown below

- We are building a Flask Application that needs  HTML pages stored in the templates folder and a python script app.py for serverside scripting
- we need the model which is saved and the saved model in this content is ECG.h5
- The static folder will contain js and CSS files.
- Whenever we upload an image to predict, those images are saved in the uploads folder.

## Prerequisites⭐
###  software  and packages 
### 1.Anaconda Navigator
